## Information aggregation from and around dgplug

*Here it is*, the first issue of the \#dgplug newsletter.

### What is DGPLUG?

DGPLUG is an acronym for the [Linux Users' Group of Durgapur][link:dgplug]. The group is however not meant to be exclusively for people living in Durgapur. Instead it is an open community that welcomes everyone that shares our interests in free and open source software, education and community.

If don't know dgplug, you can find more detailed information about dgplug while reading the blogs on the [planet][link:planet] or the [students' planet][link:students_planet]. For regular updates, make sure to subscribe to the mailing list and/or visit us in the IRC channel **\#dgplug** on the [freenode][link:freenode] network.

### What is this letter?

A lot is going on at dgplug and in the FOSS world. This newsletter is meant to aggregate the interesting activities and events that are happening for the interested (but busy) reader. This is not only exciting for dgplug members - it's quite possible that you recognize some names when reading the contributors list of your next Firefox plugin, JavaScript package or Python update.

This newsletter will summarize the past two weeks, briefly informing you about the latest dgplug blog posts, git commits, IRC channel activities and random FOSS and tech news.
