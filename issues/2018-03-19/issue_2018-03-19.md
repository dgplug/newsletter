## Open Source Contribution - A Case Report 

The cool thing about open source software is its openness. Not only that everyone is able to understand and reproduce the code, but everyone can participate and contribute - this is the biggest strength of FOSS and also what many projects depend on. You might find yourself in a situation where you have the possibility to contribute sooner than you think.

Diceware is a convenient tool to create strong random passwords. Bhavin found an uncaught exception and decided to commit a fix. To write the code and put a pull request is however just the start. Read [Bhavin's blog post about this pull request](https://geeksocket.in/blog/contributing-diceware-tool/) for all details about the exciting progress from discovering a bug to get the own code merged into the project, making it a little better.

It's encouraging to see how core developers take care, make suggestions and guide contribuors to deliver a professional fix. The things you learn and experience during a process like this are priceless.

A very much worth reading blog post for everyone who's interested in how open source realley works.
