## Information aggregation from and around dgplug

The cool thing about open source software is its openness. Not only that everyone is able to understand and reproduce the code, but everyone can participate and contribute - this is the biggest strength of FOSS and also what many projects depend on. You might find yourself in a situation where you have the possibility to contribute sooner than you think.

Diceware is a convenient tool to create strong random passwords. Bhavin found an uncaught exception and decided to commit a fix. To write the code and put a pull request is however just the start. Read [Bhavin's blog post about this pull request](https://geeksocket.in/blog/contributing-diceware-tool/) for all details about the exciting progress from discovering a bug to get the own code merged into the project, making it a little better.

It's encouraging to see how core developers take care, make suggestions and guide contribuors to deliver a professional fix. The things you learn and experience during a process like this are priceless.

A very much worth reading blog post for everyone who's interested in how open source realley works.
