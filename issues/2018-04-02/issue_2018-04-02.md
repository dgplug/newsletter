The Social Media Dilemma
-----------------------------------------

Social media take a big part in most of our lives. It combines almost every good thing the internet could possibly provide us with; information, social interaction, entertainment. However, the costs are high, as we transform ourselves into customers without any secrets. We not only share our innermost feelings and opinions with close friends, but with a company that sells our secrets to the highest bidder.

We create profiles of ourselves that are far more detailed than we would imagine, that leave third parties with more than enough information to find and exploit our vulnerabilites.

People are shocked if personal data from social media end up in hands of dubious companies, but everyone should be aware that this is nothing but the business model of social media.

Now, is possible to use social media in a responsible way? Or is cutting all bonds and abandon the advantages the reasonable approach? An open source crowd-funded ad-free social network would be an attractive solution, but already sounds [too good to be true](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/free-software-foundation-announces-crowdfunding-campaign-to-buy-facebook)
