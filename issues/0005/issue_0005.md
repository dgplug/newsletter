The introduction of information technology has ever since challenged lawmakers and lawyers, as it is in many aspects not comparable to anything else our world has seen before. Suddenly, you can copy information and media of arbitrary types infinitely and without noteworthy costs.

As one of the earliest groups to see the potential computers and their implications on our lives, early hackers defined some general rules that evolved into the [Hacker Ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic), that promotes freedom of information and sharing of the same.

At the same time, lawmakers were constantly trying to control and restrict these new freedoms; The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act [CFAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act) is a somewhat dated and impresicisely worded but nevertheless active law, that, if put accordingly, can criminalize many of our every day activities today. Among others, it prohibits violations against *Terms of Service* of websites. As a prominent example, Aaron Swartz was accused of multiple terms of service violations before committing suicide in 2013. In 2018 a [US court now decided][github_comments_13], that automatic webscraping of publicly available information is not a crime, even if stated differently in the terms of service.

While this is a small victory, it is still ridicoulous how lawmakers and terms of service cut our freedoms, obstruct research and lock away knowledge.

[John Perry Barlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow) (JPB) was an american political activist and founding member of the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://eff.org) and the [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press). Kushal wrote a [blog post](https://kushaldas.in/posts/remembering-john-perry-barlow.html) about the symposium held after JPBs death earlier this year. However, being american may not have been the way JPB would have described himself. In his [Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace][github_comments_11] he rather declares cyberspace as a non-physical space, not bound to political or geographical borders, nor bound by their laws. He declares himself and *us* as citizens of this cyberspace. Given the unique nature of this digital world, that so significantly differs from the physical and political world, the declaration states, that *we* will create *our* rules in this space respectively, as this shall not be incumbent on a government.

While we all are *citizens of both worlds* we should make the effort to harmonize their relationship. Being hackers, laws that are in conflict with our ethical codex should be opposed.

Sadly, an update in Google's App Engine now removes this feature.
