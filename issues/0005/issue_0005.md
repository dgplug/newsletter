The introduction of information technology has ever since challenged lawmakers and lawyers, as it does not compare to anything else our world was faced with so far. Suddenly, you could copy information and media of arbitrary types infinitely and without noteworthy costs.

As one of the earliest group to see its potential and implications, early hackers defined some general rules that evolved into the [Hacker ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic), that promotes freedom of information and sharing of the same.

At the same time, lawmakers were constantly trying to control and restrict these new freedoms; The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act [CFAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act) is an old but active and impresicisely worded law that, if put accordingly, can criminalize many every day activities today. Among others, it prohibits violations agains *Terms of Service* of websites. A prominent example is Aaron Swartz, who was accused of multiple Terms of Service violations before committing suicide in 2013. In 2018 a [US court now decided][github_comments_13], that automatic webscraping of publicly available information is not a crime, even if stated differently in the *Terms of Service*.

While this is a small victory, it is still ridicoulous how lawmakers and terms of service cut our freedoms, obstruct research and lock away knowledge.

[John Perry Barlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow) (JPB) was an american political activist and founding member of the EFF and the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Kushal had written a [blog post](https://kushaldas.in/posts/remembering-john-perry-barlow.html) about the symposium held after JPBs dearh. Being american may however not him the way he saw himself. In his [Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace][github_comments_11] he rather describes cyberspace as a non-physical space that is not bound to political or geographical borders, nor bound by their laws. He declares *us* as citizens of cyberspace that, given the unique nature of this digital world, that so significantly differs from the physical and political world, will create *our* rules respectively.

While we all are *citizens of both worlds* we should make the effort to harmonize their relationship. Being hackers, laws that are in conflict with our ethical codex should be opposed.
